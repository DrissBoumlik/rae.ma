<p><strong>HISTORY</strong></p>
<p>During World War II Rybinsk State Aviation Technical University was evacuated to Ufa city, where after some time Rybinsk State Aviation Technical University transformed into the Ufa Aviation Institute. New Aviation University in Rybinsk was opened on May 25<sup>th</sup> 1955 as an evening Aviation Technology Institute with two faculties – Aircraft Mechanics and technology. In 1964 Rybinsk evening Aviation Technology Institute was reorganized into the Institute with all forms of education – daytime, evening and correspondence. In 1994, Aviation Technology Institute received status of Academy. In 2011, Rybinsk Aviation Technical Academy was granted the status of State Aviation Technical University. At present Rybinsk State Aviation Technical University provides training in design and production of aircraft engines, general engineering, instrumentation, and control of the economy, socio-cultural service and tourism, quality management, information technology, programming and computer technology.</p>

<p><strong>FACULTIES:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Faculty of Aeroengines </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Faculty aeroengine founded in 1955. The engineers of this profile is carried out the development of new aerospace technology and test technology training and support for new and batch production, so they are successfully working in the structures of the settlement – the research, design, testing and technological preparation of production of aerospace engineering, as well as service production. Now there is no research that would not come into contact with its ideas and laws. These fields and professions require such training of students, which provides the most optimal system of knowledge in various fields of technical applications of physics and mathematics. Graduates work as calculators – researchers in the design organizations of teachers or exact sciences (physics, mathematics) in educational institutions.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Faculty of Aviatechnologies </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Faculty traces its history since inception in Rybinsk evening institute in 1955.
