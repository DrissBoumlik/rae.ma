    <p></p><p>Ukraine is one of few countries of the world where aviation and space engineering are developed and manufactured and where skilled specialists are trained for these areas. The <strong>National Aerospace University Kharkiv Aviation Institute</strong> is the leading one among the Ukrainian educational institutions which turn out such specialists.</p>
<p>The KhAI was founded in 1930. Its history is closely connected with the development of aircraft engineering and science. The University is famous for its creation of the first in Europe high-speed airplane with a retractable landing gear and the creation of the design of the turbojet engine developed by teacher of the KhAI A. M. Liulka who afterwards became the academician and designer of many structures of aircraft engines including the engine of the aircraft Su-27.</p>
<p><strong>Kharkiv National Aerospace University</strong> “<strong>Kharkiv Aviation Institute</strong>” (NAU “KhAI”)&nbsp; not only offers high quality services in education and science to its students and partners, but also expanding its activities in the international arena, while strengthening the existing relationships. Every year NAU “KhAI” is visited by foreign delegations which propose cooperation in research and education. A growing number of international programs and projects are carried out by the university. Recently, scientific laboratories of NAU “KhAI” complete a number of developments in the field of high technologies together with well-known enterprises and research institutions in France, Germany, Finland, Israel, Australia and other.</p>
<p>Thanks to the administration and staff the University is well-known in world educational and scientific community. National Aerospace University “KhAI” is a member of the International Association of Universities IAU / UNESCO, the European association of aviation scientists (EASN), European aviation partnership of universities PEGASUS. In 2010 NAU “KhAI” has joined the Great Charter of Universities (Magna Charta Universitatum), and in 2011 it joined the International Association of technical universities of the CIS.</p>
<p>The University implemented a unique educational and research programs with various international institutions. Through these programs students and teachers of NAU “KhAI” have the opportunity to expand their knowledge and enrich the experience of studying abroad and communicating with foreign colleagues. National Aerospace University “KhAI” conducts joint training of Ukrainian students with the Turin Polytechnic University (Italy) and the University of Otto von Guericke (Germany) and joint training of Chinese students with Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (China). According to the agreement between NAU “KhAI” and the Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics students and postgraduates of NAU “KhAI” participate the scholarship program for Masters and Postgraduates. The University every year admits foreign students to its summer school in several areas of the aerospace sector. Every year NAU “KhAI” increases the number of agreements with foreign universities and institutions wishing to implement student exchange with KhAI.</p>
<p>The University is actively involved in the fundraising. Together with European partners it received the highest number in Ukraine of scientific and educational grants TEMPUS FP-7 and the European Union. Currently, the University is participating in fundraising program ERASMUS + together with partners. Students and teachers of NAU “KhAI” participate in a such programs as DAAD, Fulbright, ERASMUS + etc. Every year more than 200 students and teachers go abroad to participate in educational and research activities.</p>
